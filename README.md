# Nuku Hiva Monarch

This project is named after a bird. Anyway, this gets my saved posts on Reddit and displays it on a website interface.

## Links

- [How to get more JSON Results](https://old.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/d7egb/how_to_get_more_json_results_i_get_only_30/)

## Planned Features

- Add Vue and front-end support
- Encryption of the link.txt file
  - Must require a user set password during runtime
- Database support for saved posts using MongoDB or that of the likes of SQL

# Nuku Hiva Monarch
This project is named after a bird. Anyway, this gets my saved posts on Reddit and displays it on a website interface.

## Planned Features
- Add Vue and front-end support
- Encryption of the link.txt file
    - Must require a user set password during runtime
- Database support for saved posts using MongoDB or that of the likes of SQL

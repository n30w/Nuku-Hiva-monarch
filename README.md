# Andthensome

Reddit only caches 1000 saved posts+comments. This is a problem if you keep saving posts and want to view your oldest ones.

The name for this project is named "Andthensome", because it has the ability to retrieve all your Reddit posts, and then some, because it can retrieve any updates as well.

## TODO

- [x] SQL Comparison function

- [x] Use a docker container for API calls
